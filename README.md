# Beagle Anomaly Detection Framework

This repository contains the basis for an anomaly detection framework for time series.

The current code is written in Python 3 and relies on the following libraries:
- PyTorch (see www.pytorch.org)
- ScikitLearn (see scikit-learn.org)

## Why Beagle?

Beagle is a dog breed which has an outstanding olfactive sense which means they can track down pretty everything that has a smell. So I decided to call the framework Beagle Anomaly Detection since I want this framework to be able to track every anomaly possible. 

And last but not least, I own a beagle dog...
